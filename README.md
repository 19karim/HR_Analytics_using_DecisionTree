HR Analytics Dataset Project

Project Overview:

This project focuses on leveraging HR Analytics to gain insights into employee attrition. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to employees, and the goal is to build a predictive model that can identify factors contributing to employee turnover.

Project Steps:

Dataset Description:

The dataset used in this project is centered around HR Analytics, containing information about employees and their attributes.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values:

Techniques were employed to handle missing values in the dataset, ensuring that the data used for training and testing is complete.

Feature Selection:

Feature selection techniques were applied to identify the most relevant attributes influencing employee attrition.

Label Encoding:

Categorical variables were label-encoded to convert them into a format suitable for training machine learning models.

Model Building:

Decision Tree Model:

A Decision Tree model was chosen for its interpretability and ability to capture complex relationships within the data.

Pruning:

The Decision Tree model underwent pruning to optimize its structure, avoiding overfitting and enhancing generalization performance.

Logistic Regression:

Logistic Regression was also employed to explore alternative modeling approaches. However, the model's accuracy was not satisfactory, leading to a focus on the Decision Tree model.

Training and Evaluation:

The selected model (Decision Tree with pruning) was trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated for its performance.

Predictions on Test Data:

The trained model was used to make predictions on a separate test dataset to assess its generalization capabilities.

Results:

The project concluded with the identification of the best-performing model, based on accuracy and other relevant metrics. The results provide valuable insights into employee attrition factors, offering a foundation for proactive HR strategies and decision-making.
